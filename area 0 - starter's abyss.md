# possible tower concepts

## confirmed:
*these may be slightly changed, but their general premise is what will be used.*

> [!example] Tower of Simple Beginnings
> slot: *IT-1*
> 
> tutorial tower to teach you all the basic mechanics. 
> - required for progression
> - goes over purism gameplay, trusses, light basic co's [spinners, x pushers, buttons {not in detail}]
> 
> creators:
> solo [anza]
---
> [!example] Tower of Button Activated Platforms
> slot: *IT-2*
> 
> button tutorial tower, teaches about all different types of buttons. [pushbox, click, normal, timed, morphers]
> 
> - f1: intro to buttons, showcasing their values [hide, inverted, timed]
> - f2: expansion, goes outside a bit more and uses larger structures 
> - f3: pushboxes; compact game play [all inside]
> - f4: click buttons, used clicked and normal with some timed mini sections [?]
> - f5: 4 different button challenges - push box, timed, click, normal
>
> **to do:**
> - change right side frame design to be a bit simpler, change open frame design too
> - make frame for f4 and f5 [separate f5, button challenges on each side. possible star theming]
> - add music [f2, f4-walkin, f5-polymer]
>
>progress: f2 start
>
> creators:
> anza [solo]

 > [!example] Tower of Damage Control
> slot: *IT-3*

> [!example] Tower of No Boost Items
> slot: *MT-3*
> 
> teaches about boosts - speed boosters, jump boosters, no jump and more. [speed pads, jump pads, elevators, x pusher momentum..?, fading platforms..?]

> creators:

*these ideas are much more subject to change and further development.*
